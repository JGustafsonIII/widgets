# Widgets Application

## Purpose of this applicaiton

This application was used to learn some of the basic hooks React has to offer. The ones that were used in making these widgets are useState, useEffect, and useRef. The project was done as a code along with Stephon Grider from his [Modern React with Redux Course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WcYCUISdVdRQQ==/).
